# Sane Node Development

>> NOTE: Early, just starting out.

## Goals

Create a sample service which illustrates sane node development avoiding some of the historic problems.

**Eliminate callback hell**  

Use async/await along with promises to write logical sane code while still maintaining the benefits of async execution

**Compile time support**  

Uses typescript for compiling to find common issues earlier.

**Debug**

Illustrate how to debug

**Highly Testable and Tested**

Factor code in a way to ensure all paths are testable and tested.
